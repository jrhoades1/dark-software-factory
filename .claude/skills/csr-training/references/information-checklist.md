## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| Not getting gate code | Tech arrives and can't get in — wastes time |
| Not asking about additional structures | Tech may need to check pool house or dock |
| Not counting pool features | Pricing will be wrong — customer gets surprised |
| Not verifying phone is a cell | Tech can't reach customer to confirm en route |
| Not asking about previous service | Miss opportunity to reference history, build trust |
| Not getting plumber's contact info | Can't follow up on referral partnership |
