## Excellent Example: Residential Slab Leak with Plumber Referral

**Call ID:** 46409670 | **CSR:** (unnamed) | **Customer:** Michael Levy, Boca Raton
**Type:** Residential potable water, 6 bathrooms, plumber referral

### What Happened

Michael was referred by Zicaro Plumbing. High water bill and hot water heater running continuously. Two-story home, 6 bathrooms, pool with auto-fill (already checked — no leak there). Lives in Royal Palm Polo (gated).

### Annotated Highlights

**[GOOD] Quick qualification — identified the issue type fast:**
> CSR: "Okay, it's a single family home, a town home or a condo?"
> Customer: "Single family home."
> CSR: "And how many bathrooms do you have? Just so we have an indication of the plumbing."

Immediately moves from property type to bathrooms — knows this drives pricing.

**[GOOD] Asks about additional structures:**
> CSR: "If you have anything in your backyard with additional plumbing like a mother-in-law suite, pool house, or dock line?"

This is critical — missing additional structures means the tech arrives unprepared.

**[GOOD] Probes for symptoms before jumping to the script:**
> CSR: "Did they check to see if your meter was running at all?"
> Customer: "Yeah... we turn off the water to the house and the meter stops."

Shows active listening and diagnostic thinking. Confirms the leak is on the customer's side.

**[GOOD] Gets the referring plumber's info:**
> CSR: "Do you have the phone number to Zicaro Plumbing?"
> Customer: "561-547-7103."

This is how we maintain referral partnerships — always get the plumber's contact.

**[GOOD] Clean service explanation + pricing + scheduling in one smooth flow:**
> CSR: "Our tech will determine if the leak is on your hot or cold plumbing line. If so, he'll use electronic leak detection equipment or compressed air to locate that leak. Once the leak is identified, the tech will mark the area for whoever you choose to make that repair for you. So for the leak detection, it will be $650 for the first two hours and $150 for each additional hour we are on site. Would you like our next available?"

Note: $650/150 because 6 bathrooms (5-6 bath tier). Script, pricing, and call-to-action in one breath.

**[GOOD] Clear closing with access requirements:**
> CSR: "So we'll be going out tomorrow. Our tech is going to give you a call when he's on his way, and he'll be arriving between 9 and 10. We need full access to the home, and that no water is being used while we're on site."

Everything David needs to model: efficient, professional, thorough.

## Excellent Example: Residential Slab Leak with Scheduling Flexibility

**Call ID:** 46409395 | **CSR:** (unnamed) | **Customer:** Shantara Johnson, West Palm Beach
**Type:** Residential potable water, 2 bathrooms, return customer

### What Happened

Shantara is a return customer (last visited in 2020). Meter spinning, heard water, no visible leak. She's a teacher calling from school. Needs Monday morning appointment because her husband picks up grandkids from three different schools in the afternoon.

### Annotated Highlights

**[GOOD] Recognized return customer and pulled up history:**
> CSR: "You all have been here before."
> Customer: "Yeah, but that was back in 2020."
> CSR: "Okay, I have that up here."

Using ServiceTitan to reference previous visits builds trust.

**[GOOD] Thorough symptom gathering:**
> CSR: "So, heard water. And you shut off the valve and then the meter stopped, correct?"
> Customer: "Yes, yes, correct."
> CSR: "And you don't, do you see any water anywhere?"

Confirms the symptoms and checks for visible water — methodical approach.

**[GOOD] Empathy with scheduling challenges:**
> Customer: "My husband got to pick the grandkids up from school. It's three different schools."
> CSR: "Oh, yeah. High school, little school and elementary. That's busy."

Natural, warm response — builds rapport without burning time.

**[GOOD] Flexible scheduling while accommodating:**
> CSR: "Well, I do have Monday available. August 25th. I will put it as a morning time for you."

Found a solution that works for the customer's schedule.

**[GOOD] Verification of all details before closing:**
> CSR: "So have your address — that was 1371 6th Street, West Palm Beach. The phone number I have here, 561-294-9252. Is that a good one for contact? And the email address, ShanJJ@self.net. Is that a good one?"

Reads everything back. This is exactly right.

**[IMPROVE] Background noise / interruption handling:**
The customer is a teacher — a school announcement interrupted the service explanation mid-sentence. The CSR handled it gracefully ("Oh, it's okay") and restarted the script. Better approach: pause cleanly, wait, then restart from the beginning of the explanation rather than trying to talk through it.

**[IMPROVE] Hold time communication:**
There's a ~30 second hold around [05:25] with no update. When holds go longer than expected, check back in: "I appreciate your patience, just one more moment."

## Learning Example: Out-of-Scope Inquiry

**Call ID:** 46409778 | **CSR:** (unnamed) | **Customer:** Joe Ronnie, Brickers of Palm Beach
**Type:** Out-of-scope (gas leak inquiry)

### What Happened

Joe calls asking if ALD does gas leaks. Very short call (~27 seconds).

### Annotated Transcript

> Customer: "Do you guys do gas leaks?"
> CSR: "Gas leaks... gas leaks like... yeah, like... natural gas."
> CSR: "Oh, gas leaks. No... yeah. No. Yeah. No. No, we do not."

**[IMPROVE] Fumbled response — seemed confused:**

The CSR hesitated and gave a messy "no, yeah, no" answer. This should be clean and confident.

**Better approach:**

> "We specialize in **water leak detection** — unfortunately, we don't handle gas leaks. I'd recommend contacting your gas company or a licensed gas plumber for that. Is there anything else I can help with?"

Be direct, be helpful, offer a redirect. Don't fumble — know what we do and don't do.

**[NOTE]** ALD actually CAN do gas line detection ($150 per tank of helium). If the CSR had known this, they could have at least mentioned it as an option. Always check the pricing guide before saying "we don't do that."
