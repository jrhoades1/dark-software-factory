# Insurance Job Checklist

> Reference: `csr-training` skill
> Insurance jobs have a different workflow than standard residential or commercial calls.

---

## 1. Confirm All Information

- [ ] **Verify address and phone number**
- [ ] **Apartment/unit number** (if applicable)
- [ ] **Property type:**
  - Single family home
  - Townhouse / Town home
  - Condo
- [ ] **For Condos:**
  - Which floor is the unit on?
  - Does the homeowner have access to the unit below (if applicable)?

---

## 2. Job Considerations

- If the unit is **above the first floor**, access to additional units may be needed depending on the issue
- For **first-floor units** with crawlspace, the tech may need access to the unit above
- **Full property access** is required — no water running during detection
- Without access, detection cannot be made

---

## 3. Schedule the Job

- Book within standard tech hours (9 AM – 3 PM)
- **Avoid giving a specific time** — just provide the date and time window
- The day before, we'll narrow down to a 2-hour window

---

## 4. Public Adjuster Involvement

- Confirm **who the on-site contact person** will be
- Get their **contact number** — if we cannot reach the contact, the tech will move on
- Ask if a public adjuster is involved and note this in ServiceTitan

---

## 5. National Job & Upcharge Approval

- For **exceptional jobs** (complex scope, difficult access, unusual circumstances):
  - Check if approval is needed for any surcharges
  - **Anything above $550** may require adjuster approval first
  - If so, **get approval from the adjuster** before scheduling
