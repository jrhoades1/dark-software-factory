# DSF Business Model

> Last updated: 2026-02-23

## What We Sell

Not software. Not subscriptions. Not skills files.

We sell **speed-to-insight and speed-to-build** for businesses whose data is
locked in systems they can't query and whose problems are too small for
traditional consulting but too complex for off-the-shelf tools.

## What We Don't Sell

- **Skills files** — Open source. They're the portfolio, not the product.
  Markdown files have zero defensibility. Like shareware on a BBS — once
  someone sees it, they can copy it.
- **SaaS subscriptions** — Race to the bottom. High churn, feature wars,
  support overhead. The platform vendor can build it themselves tomorrow.
- **"AI consulting"** — Generic, commoditizing fast, and the client thinks
  they're already the expert on their own business.

## The Ladder

Nobody writes a big check to someone they just met. Trust is built in steps.

| Step | What they buy | Price | What it proves |
|------|---------------|-------|----------------|
| **1. Free** | Case study, blog post, LinkedIn content, open source repo | $0 | "This person knows my world" |
| **2. Taste** | Single analysis — one question answered from their data | $250-500 | "That actually worked" |
| **3. Meal** | Focused build — one automation, integration, or tool | $1,500-3,000 | "Ships fast, works right" |
| **4. Relationship** | Bigger builds, ongoing work, referrals | $5,000+ | Earned trust, not sold trust |

**Step 2 is everything.** A $250 analysis that takes 20 minutes of real work.
The client gets something immediately useful. They've *experienced* the value —
not read about it, not watched a demo. The person who pays $250 and gets a real
answer will pay $3k next month without flinching.

Step 1 gets attention. Step 2 gets trust. Everything after that is repeat business.

## The Contractor Model

Not a consultant. Not a SaaS founder. A contractor.

Show up with Claude + MCP + skills library. Build what the client needs. Get paid.
Leave. If it needs maintenance, that's a separate engagement.

| What we do | What it costs them | What it replaces |
|---|---|---|
| Connect their data to AI | $5-15k | A BI project that takes 3 months |
| Build an internal tool | $3-10k | A SaaS subscription they'll outgrow |
| Run a specific analysis | $250-3k | A consulting engagement at 5x the price |
| Automate a workflow | $2-8k | A full-time employee doing it manually |

No recurring revenue anxiety. No churn. No support tickets. Build, hand over, move on.

## Why This Works Now

Before AI-assisted development, a solo contractor couldn't compete with agencies
or SaaS companies on speed or scope. Now we can. The DSF framework means shipping
in days what used to take teams weeks. Cost basis is time + API tokens. No
employees, no infrastructure, no runway.

## The Compounding Effect

Each engagement makes the next one faster and better:
- Each build → new skills and patterns (the system gets smarter)
- Each client → new case study (the portfolio gets stronger)
- Each case study → higher rates (the price goes up)
- Higher rates → better clients (the work gets more interesting)

## The Moat

Skills are cheap to make but expensive to get right. The Five-Dimension Check
exists because we ran a real analysis, got it 188% wrong, caught it, and codified
the correction. Anyone can write a skill file. Not everyone has the operational
knowledge to make it correct.

The open source repo proves the depth. The case studies prove the results. The
client who reads `servicetitan-analysis` and tries to run it themselves will hit
exactly the problems we already solved — and then they call us.

## Target Markets

Primary: businesses with data locked in vertical SaaS platforms (ServiceTitan,
HouseCall Pro, Jobber, etc.) who can't get custom analysis without expensive
BI projects.

Secondary buyers who manage multiple operators:
- Franchisors (50-200 locations, can't standardize reporting)
- PE roll-ups (bought multiple companies, need cross-portfolio comparison)
- Multi-location owners (3-10 locations, no consolidated view)

These buyers don't think they're experts. They know they have a data problem.

## First Client Playbook

1. Package ALD analysis as a blog post / case study
2. Reach out to 5 ServiceTitan shops in network
3. Offer the first taste at $250-500
4. Deliver in one session, hand over a spreadsheet
5. Follow up with "what else have you been wondering about?"
6. Let step 2 lead to step 3 naturally

The only conversion that matters is getting someone to step 2.
