## Script 1: New Residential Slab Leak (Potable Water)

This is your most common call — customer has a high water bill, running meter, or wet spot.

### Opening

> "Good morning/afternoon, this is **[Name]** with American Leak Detection. How may I help you?"

*Listen to their description. Identify it as a slab leak / potable water issue.*

### Information Collection

> "I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me get some information from you."

Collect in this order:

1. **Name:** "Can I get your first and last name? And how do you spell the last name?"
2. **Address:** "What's the address of the property? And the zip code?"
3. **Phone:** "What's the best phone number to reach you? Is that a cell phone?"
4. **Email:** "And an email address?"
5. **Property type:** "Is this a single family home or condo?"
6. **Bathrooms:** "How many bathrooms in the home?"
7. **Gated:** "Are you in a gated community? What's the gate code?"
8. **Stories:** "Is it single or two-story?"
9. **Additional structures:** "Any additional structures on the property — pool house, mother-in-law suite, dock?"
10. **Referral:** "How did you hear about us?"

### Service Explanation (Ken's Approved Script)

> "So what our technician will do is determine if the leak is related to your hot or cold plumbing lines. We rule out with electronic detection equipment if the leak is on the hot or cold line, and then we use compressed air to locate the leak in that line and mark an area 18 inches to 3 feet for whoever you choose to do the repair."

### Pricing

**Based on bathroom count:**

| Bathrooms | Price |
|---|---|
| 1–4 | "$550" |
| 5–6 | "$650 for the first two hours and $200 for each additional hour" |
| 7+ | "$750 for the first two hours and $200 for each additional hour" |
| Condo | "$650 for the first two hours and $150 for each additional hour" |

> "For us to do the leak detection, it'll be **$550**. That can be paid by cash, check, or credit card when the technician is on site."

**Check surcharges** (South Bay/Belle Glade/Pahokee/Okeechobee +$100; Sailfish Point/Indiantown +$50).

### Scheduling

> "Let me see what we have available... I have **[date]** between **[time window]**. Does that work for you?"

### Access & Requirements

> "We kindly ask that we have full access to the home and that no water is being used when our technician is on site."

### Closing

> "All right, so we have you on for **[date]** between **[time]** at **[address]**. We'll give you a call the day before to confirm and narrow that down to a two-hour window. Our technician will call you when he's on his way. If he's unable to reach you, he will move on to the next appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

> "Thank you so much. Have a great day!"

## Script 2: New Residential Pool Leak

### Opening

> "Good morning/afternoon, this is **[Name]** with American Leak Detection. How may I help you?"

### Information Collection

Standard contact info (name, address, phone, email), PLUS:

1. "Is it **pool only, spa only, or a pool/spa combination**?"
2. "Does the pool have a **spillover** into the spa?" *(If pool/spa)*
3. "How many **skimmers** does the pool have?"

7. "Any **free-standing fountains or waterfalls**?" (GO SEE 1ST)

### Service Explanation (Ken's Approved Script)

> "Pools typically leak in one of two places: the plumbing or the structure. Our tech will first use compressed air to locate leaks in the plumbing lines, then they will dive into the pool to inspect structural areas like lights, tile, liners, skimmers, main drains, and returns. Anything we caulk and putty is included in the fee for residential pools. Our leak detection comes with a 60-day warranty."

### Pricing

| Configuration | Price |
|---|---|
| Pool only or spa only (1 skimmer) | $395 |
| Pool/spa with spillover (1 skimmer) | $495 |
| + Extra skimmer | +$50 |
| + 2 features | +$75 |
| + 3+ features | QUOTE FROM TECH |
| + Fiberglass spa | +$75 |
| + Negative edge | +$100 |
| + Valet/Caretaker (1-10 heads) | +$100 |
| + Valet/Caretaker (10-20 heads) | $10/head |

Calculate total and quote:

> "For your pool with one skimmer and spillover, that comes to **$495**. Cash, check, or credit card."

### Pool-Specific Requirements

> "We do ask that the **pool is clean, clear, and full** upon our arrival so the technician can perform a proper inspection."

## Script 7: Referral Partner (Plumber) Call

> "Good morning/afternoon, this is **[Name]** with American Leak Detection."

Plumber will explain they have a customer who needs leak detection. Collect:

1. **Customer's info** — Name, address, phone, email (same as standard)
2. **Plumber's info** — Name, company name, phone number
3. **What's been done** — "What has your tech already looked at?"
4. **Payment arrangement** — Who's paying? Customer direct or plumber invoiced?
5. **Contract/agreement** — "Have you sent the contract back yet?" (if applicable)
6. **Findings callback** — "Would you like us to call you with what we find?"

### Key Notes

- Always get the plumber's direct phone so our tech can call them with findings
- If a contract is needed, follow up: "I'll just need that contract signed and sent back prior to us coming out."
- These calls build referral business — be extra professional and accommodating

## Script 8: Out-of-Scope Inquiry

When a customer asks about something we don't do.

### Gas Leaks

> "We specialize in **water leak detection**. Unfortunately, we don't handle gas leaks. I'd recommend contacting your **gas company** or a licensed **gas plumber** for that."

### Sewer / Drain Issues

> "We specialize in **water leak detection** — we don't do sewer or drain work. A licensed **plumber** would be able to help you with that."

### General Plumbing Repairs

> "Our specialty is **locating leaks** — we don't do the actual plumbing repairs. Once we find and mark the leak location, you'd have your plumber handle the repair."

**Note:** We DO offer sewer cam services ($750 — call KK for scheduling). If the customer's issue could benefit from a sewer cam, mention it: "We do offer sewer camera inspections. Let me get some details and check availability for that."

### Key Rule

Be **direct and helpful** — don't fumble or seem unsure. Know what we do and what we don't.
