## The Scheduling Flow

After you've collected all customer information and delivered the service explanation:

### Step 1: Quote the Price

State the price clearly and confidently:

> "For us to do the leak detection, it'll be **$550**."

Or for pools:

> "For a pool-only detection with one skimmer, that's **$395**."

Then: "Cash, check, or credit card when the technician is on site."

**Check for surcharges before quoting:**
- South Bay, Belle Glade, Pahokee, Okeechobee → add $100
- Sailfish Point, Indiantown → add $50

### Step 2: Check Availability

> "Let me see what we have available for you... Give me just one moment."

- Check the schedule in ServiceTitan
- If you need to put them on hold, ask first: "May I put you on a brief hold while I check the schedule?"
- Keep holds under 60 seconds whenever possible

### Step 3: Offer a Date and Time Window

> "I have **Wednesday, the 20th** available. Would a morning or afternoon work better for you?"

**Standard time windows:**
| Window | Hours |
|---|---|
| Early morning | 8:00 – 9:00 AM |
| Late morning | 10:00 AM – 12:00 PM |
| Afternoon | 1:00 – 3:00 PM |

- Always offer the **next available** first
- If the customer can't make it, offer alternatives
- Same-day or next-day availability is common — offer it when possible

### Step 4: Confirm the Appointment

Repeat everything back:

> "All right, so we have you on for **Wednesday, August 20th**, between **10 and 12**, at **1371 6th Street, West Palm Beach**. Does that sound good?"

### Step 5: Explain Access Requirements

**For all jobs:**

> "We kindly ask that we have full access to the home and that no water is being used when our technician is on site."

**For pool jobs, add:**

> "The pool must be clean, clear, and full upon our arrival."

**For gated communities:**

> "And the gate code is **[code]**, correct?"

### Step 6: Explain the Reminder Protocol

> "We'll give you a call the day before to confirm your appointment and narrow that down to a two-hour time frame."

### Step 7: Explain the Arrival Protocol

> "Our technician will give you a call when he's on his way. He'll try to give you about a half-hour heads up. **If he's unable to reach you, he will move on to the next appointment**, so please make sure to answer."

This is critical — emphasize it. Missed calls = wasted truck rolls.

### Step 8: Professional Closing

> "You're all set! Is there anything else I can help you with?"

Then:

> "Thank you so much. Have a great day!"

## Handling Scheduling Challenges

### Customer Needs a Specific Time

> "I'll note that preference and we'll do our best to accommodate. We'll confirm the exact window when we call the day before."

### Customer Can't Make Any Available Dates

- Offer to put them on a **cancellation list**: "If something opens up sooner, I'll give you a call."
- Check the following week's availability
- Note their preferred days/times in ServiceTitan

### Customer Wants to Reschedule Later

> "No problem at all. Just give us a call back when you're ready and we'll get you on the schedule. Our number is **[office number]**."

### Customer Requests One-Hour Notice for Arrival

> "Our tech will do his best to give you notice, but I can't guarantee a specific lead time. We'll narrow it down to a two-hour window the day before, which should help you plan."

### Long Wait / Hold Time

If the schedule check is taking longer than expected:

> "I apologize for the wait. I'm just pulling up the schedule now — one more moment."

Never leave someone on hold without an update for more than 60 seconds.
