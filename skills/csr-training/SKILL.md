# CSR Training Skill

## Intent

1. **Script fidelity to Ken's approved language** — the service descriptions are verbatim for a reason; a CSR improvising technical explanations creates liability and customer confusion
2. **Complete information collection on every call** — the technician arrives prepared only if the CSR gathered all required customer, property, and issue details; missing data wastes a truck roll
3. **Never diagnose or troubleshoot** — the CSR is not a technician; redirecting warmly to "our tech will determine that on site" protects the company and the customer
4. **Pricing discipline without exceptions** — the price chart is the price chart; discounting erodes margins and sets expectations that cannot be sustained
5. **Book appointments that convert to completed jobs** — every call that ends with a scheduled appointment is revenue; every call that ends with "I'll think about it" is a missed opportunity
6. **Collect complete information before scheduling** — incomplete data means callbacks, reschedules, and unprepared technicians
7. **Calls target 10-12 minutes; scheduling under 2 minutes** — efficiency keeps the phone lines available, but never at the cost of missing required information

**Territory:** Palm Beach, Martin, & St. Lucie Counties (each office independently owned and operated).

## The #1 Rule (From Ken)

> **Keep the call focused — collect, book, confirm.** You are not a technician. Don't try to diagnose or troubleshoot the customer's issue — the tech handles that on site. Be warm and professional, but keep the call moving. Your job is to gather the info, explain the service, quote the price, and book the appointment.

If a customer wants to go deep into what's causing their leak, redirect warmly:

> "That's a great question — our technician is the expert on that and he'll be able to determine exactly what's going on when he's on site. Let me get you taken care of and scheduled."

## The ALD Call Handling Method

Every call follows six steps. Master the flow, then the details follow naturally.

| Step | What You Do | Why It Matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1. **Greet** | Professional opening, identify yourself and the company | Sets the tone — warm, confident, helpful |
| 2. **Qualify** | Ask what's going on, identify the service type | Determines which script and pricing to use |
| 3. **Collect** | Gather all required customer and property information | Technician needs this to arrive prepared |
| 4. **Explain** | Deliver the approved service description for that type | Ken's scripts — use verbatim |
| 5. **Price & Schedule** | Quote from the price chart, book the appointment | No surprises for the customer |
| 6. **Confirm & Close** | Repeat details, explain next steps, professional sign-off | Prevents no-shows and miscommunication |

---

## Step 1: Opening Script

> "Good morning/afternoon, this is **[Your Name]** with American Leak Detection. How may I help you?"

**Key points:**
- Warm, professional tone — not robotic
- Use the customer's name once you have it (builds rapport)
- Listen actively — let them describe their problem before jumping in

---

## Step 2: Qualify the Service Type

Based on what the customer describes, determine which service they need:

| Customer Says... | Service Type | Script to Use |
|---|---|---|
| "My pool is losing water" / "Not holding chlorine" | Pool/Spa Leak | Residential or Commercial Pool |
| "Water bill is high" / "Meter keeps running" | Slab Leak (Potable Water) | Slab Leak Script |
| "Water damage on wall/ceiling" / "Wet spot on floor" | Source & Origin | Source & Origin Script |
| "I'm a plumber, my customer has a leak" | Referral Partner | Plumber Referral Script |
| "Do you do gas leaks?" | Out of Scope | Polite Redirect |

---

## Step 3: Collect Information

**Every call — collect ALL of these:**

### Customer Contact
- Full name (spell it out letter by letter to confirm)
- Phone number — "Is that a cell phone?"
- Email address
- Physical address with zip code
- City verification

### Property Details
- Property type: single family home, condo, commercial, pool
- Number of bathrooms (drives pricing for potable water)
- Gated community? If yes, gate code
- Number of stories
- Additional structures: pool house, mother-in-law suite, dock

### Issue Details
- Symptoms described in customer's words
- How long has this been happening?
- Previous service history (check ServiceTitan)
- Location indicators ("around the kitchen," "by the pool equipment")

### Pool-Specific (if applicable)
- Pool only, spa only, or pool/spa combo?
- Spillover between pool and spa?
- Number of skimmers
- Features: fiberglass spa, negative edge, valet/caretaker heads (count them)
- Commercial: estimated gallons, number of gutter plates

### Referral Source
- "How did you hear about us?"
- If plumber referral: plumber's name, company, phone number
- "Would you like us to call them with our findings?"

## Step 4: Service Type Scripts (Ken's Approved — Use Verbatim)

### Residential Pool / Spa

> "Pools typically leak in one of two places: the plumbing or the structure. Our tech will first use compressed air to locate leaks in the plumbing lines, then they will dive into the pool to inspect structural areas like lights, tile, liners, skimmers, main drains, and returns. Anything we caulk and putty is included in the fee for residential pools. Our leak detection comes with a 60-day warranty."

**Important:** Caulk and putty repairs included for **residential pools only** — NOT commercial.

### Commercial Pool

> "Pools typically leak in one of two places: the plumbing or the structure. Our tech will first use compressed air to locate leaks in the plumbing lines, then they will dive into the pool to inspect structural areas like lights, tile, liners, skimmers, main drains, and returns."

Then add: "If minor underwater repairs are found that can be patched on site, those will be **$100** in addition to the detection fee. Our leak detection comes with a 60-day warranty."

### Slab Leak (Potable Water Lines)

> "Our technician will determine if the leak is related to your hot or cold plumbing lines. We rule out with electronic detection equipment if the leak is on the hot or cold line, and then we use compressed air to locate the leak in that line and mark an area 18 inches to 3 feet for whoever you choose to do the repair."

**Key phrase:** "Turn them back to their plumber for the repair" — we detect, we don't repair plumbing.

### Source & Origin

> "We use electronic leak detection equipment to rule out potable plumbing, then we would use an infrared camera and a moisture detector to trace it back to the source."

This is typically for insurance claims or when the customer sees water damage but doesn't know where it's coming from.

### Scheduling Workflow

1. "Let me check what we have available for you..."
2. Offer a specific date and time window
3. **Standard windows:** 8–9 AM, 10 AM–12 PM, 1–3 PM
4. Confirm: repeat date, time, and address back to the customer
5. Access requirements: "We kindly ask that we have full access to the home and that no water is being used when our technician is on site."
6. For pools: "The pool must be clean, clear, and full upon our arrival."
7. Reminder protocol: "We'll give you a call the day before to confirm and narrow that down to a two-hour window."
8. Arrival: "Our technician will call you when he's on his way. If he doesn't reach you, he will move on to the next appointment."

## Step 6: Confirm & Close

### Confirmation Script

> "All right, so we have you on for **[date]**, between **[time window]**, at **[address]**. We'll call you the day before to confirm. Our tech will give you a call when he's on his way. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

### Professional Closing

> "Thank you so much. Have a great day!"

Keep it warm and natural — don't rush the goodbye.

## Common Situations

### Objection: Pricing Concerns

- Acknowledge: "I understand, let me make sure I have the right service for your situation."
- If appropriate, confirm the simpler/cheaper option fits their needs.
- Don't discount — the price chart is the price chart.

### Objection: Scheduling Conflicts

- Be flexible: "Let me see what else I have..."
- Offer to put them on a cancellation list if the next slot is far out.
- If they need a specific time: "I'll note that preference, and we'll do our best to accommodate."

### Referral Partner (Plumber) Calls

- Get the customer's info as usual
- Get the plumber's name, company, and phone number
- Ask: "Would you like us to call them with what we find?"
- Check if a contract/agreement is needed: "Have you sent the contract back yet?"

### Out-of-Scope Inquiries

> "We specialize in water leak detection. Unfortunately, we don't handle **[gas leaks / sewer issues / etc.]**. I'd recommend contacting a **[gas company / plumber / etc.]** for that."

Be direct and helpful — don't fumble.

### Internal Coordination / Dispatch

- When coordinating with technicians, have the full customer info ready
- Provide gate codes, access notes, on-site contact numbers
- If there were previous service issues, brief the tech before dispatch

---

## Important Rules

### PCI Compliance (Credit Card Handling)

- After a credit card is provided, you can **only see and confirm the last four digits**
- The CC stays on file
- **A CC on file is required for all contracts** (especially commercial and insurance jobs)

### 72-Hour Pool Rule

If a pool has been **drained or recently had chemicals added**, schedule the appointment **at least 3 days out (72 hours)** to allow the pool to refill and chemicals to stabilize. The pool must be clean, clear, and full upon arrival.

### Tech Working Hours

Technicians work **9 AM to 3 PM**. Schedule appointments within these hours. Standard time windows: 8–9 AM (early), 10 AM–12 PM, 1–3 PM.

## Insurance Jobs

Insurance jobs have a different workflow. Key differences:

1. **Confirm all information** — address, phone, apartment/unit number
2. **Property type matters** — for condos, ask which floor; does homeowner have access to unit below?
3. **Access considerations:**
   - If above first floor, access to additional units may be needed
   - For first-floor units with crawlspace, need access to unit above
   - Full property access required, no water running
4. **Avoid giving a specific time** — just book the window
5. **Public adjuster involvement** — confirm who the on-site contact is; get their number if the homeowner can't be there
6. **National job & upcharge approval** — anything above $550 may need adjuster approval first
